> ## Old Note from Forked Repo
> ### PROJECT ABANDONED
>
>Android 8 disallows any app to draw over notification panel or navigation buttons,
so Pixel Filter cannot work properly on any newer phone, and nothing can be done about that.
>
>Last known bugs:
>- Add Poisson-disc sampling algorithm for lulz.
>- Option to start on battery percentage.
>- Fix crashes when watching light level and rotating the phone.
>- Diagonal lines on some devices - auto-calibrate bitmap offset using a screenshot.
>- Filter does not cover navigation buttons fully when the keyboard is shown.
